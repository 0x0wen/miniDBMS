## 🔑 Key Features
Developing this query processor has been a challenging task, but we aim to go beyond the basics. We have implemented additional functionalities, including several bonus specifications, which will be explained [here](./docs/key-features.md).

## 🧑‍⚖️ Workload Distribution
To ensure efficient development and collaboration, we have strategically distributed the workload among team members, as detailed [here](./docs/workload-distribution.md).

## 🏭 Class Diagram of Query Processor
